# Power&LED board version 1.0 in development

A power board was developed to replace the standard board of Xiaomi and Aqara gateways, in order to install addressable diodes on it in regular places

## Schematic diagram of the board

## Boards received from the factory and fitting on a regular place

The board is designed as a layout. What power supply will be used is not known. Need at least 5V 700mA.

The selection of a ready-made power supply is not an easy task, since there is very little space. The 5V 2A power supply that I had in stock is suitable with a margin. But it is above free space. I will have to cut through the board and install the power supply through it.

It came out like this. Such a board becomes a regular place. You need to figure out the moment of connection to the 220V plug

## Testing
The board has been tested. PSU working and with a large margin. The diodes are working. To install the board-to-board connector, I assembled everything on the plastic of the gateway to a regular place, and then soldered the connector. So he ended up in exactly the right place. Now it remains to collect everything in the gateway.
